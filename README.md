## üì¶ Quick Setup

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd cerebras-demo
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Copy the example environment file and configure:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your settings:

```bash
# Database URL for Prisma (SQLite for local development)
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

# OpenRouter API key for accessing AI models
# Get your key from: https://openrouter.ai/keys
# This is optional - users can provide their own keys in the frontend
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-v1-your-openrouter-api-key-here"
```

### 3. Database Setup with Prisma

The application uses Prisma with SQLite for data persistence. Set up the database:

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Push database schema to create tables
npx prisma db push

# Optional: View your database in Prisma Studio
npx prisma studio
```

**Database Schema Overview:**
- `ChessGame`: Stores chess match data, moves, analysis, and results
- `ModelMatch`: Stores model comparison results from text challenges

**Available Prisma Commands:**
```bash
# Generate Prisma client after schema changes
npx prisma generate

# Apply schema changes to database
npx prisma db push

# Reset database (warning: deletes all data)
npx prisma db reset

# View and edit data in browser
npx prisma studio

# Create and apply migrations (for production)
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

### 4. Start Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

## üîë API Key Options

The application supports flexible API key management:

### Option 1: Server-Side Keys (Default)
Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in your `.env.local` file. All users will use this server key.

### Option 2: User-Provided Keys (Recommended)
Users can provide their own OpenRouter API keys in the frontend:
- Navigate to `/chess` 
- Enter your OpenRouter API key in the "API Key" field
- The application will use your personal credits instead of server resources
- Leave empty to fall back to server key

**Benefits of User Keys:**
- ‚úÖ Users control their own costs and rate limits
- ‚úÖ Access to premium models with your subscription
- ‚úÖ Better privacy (your API calls don't go through server)
- ‚úÖ No impact on server quotas

## üéØ How to Use

### Chess Battle (Main Feature)
1. **Navigate to /chess** (or click "LLM Chess Arena" on homepage)
2. **Optionally enter your OpenRouter API key** for personal billing
3. **Select two different AI models** from the dropdown menus
4. **Click "Start Battle"** and watch the AI models play chess
5. **Observe real-time gameplay** with move analysis and thinking process
6. **Check the leaderboard** for running statistics and win rates
